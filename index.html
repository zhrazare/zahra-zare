    <h1>welcome to my page</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Zahra Zare, a 19-year-old computer engineering student from Amol.
        I’m passionate about web design and enjoy exploring creative ways to build beautiful websites.
        I also love learning English and listening to music in my free time.
        Nothing makes me happier than walking on autumn days and feeling the calm energy of the season.</p>
